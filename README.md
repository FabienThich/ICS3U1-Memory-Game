# ICS3U1-Memory-Game

The program is a memory game which uses pygame. The screen will display random colours on the screen which the users will have to memorize in a short period of time, then repeat it back to the console. The user will have an option to pick how many colours they wish to memorize. The user will have one guess and one guess only, failing to give the right order of colours on the first try will result in a loss.
